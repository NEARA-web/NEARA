    You can reserve books now for pick-up at the next conference, or we can arrange for some other way
    to get the books to you.  But note that some of the books in our collection are non-circulating,
    even though they may currently be listed as "Available".
  </p>
  <p>
    The move to the space in Nashua means we are deaccessioning some duplicate and extraneous titles.
    These books and videos will be offered for sale to members online and at conferences.
    To see the collection of books that we are deaccessioning, look at the list of 
    <a href="https://www.librarycat.org/lib/NEARA.Library/search/tag/sell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEARA Library books for sale</a>.
    This list will be updated occasionally, so come back to see what new books have been added to it.
    You can reserve books now for purchase at the next conference, or we can arrange for some other way
    to get the books to you.
