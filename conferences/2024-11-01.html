  <h2>Fall 2024 Conference -- our 60th Anniversary</h2>
  <p>The theme for the conference will be: <ttl>NEARA through Time: 60 Years of Research</ttl>.</p>

  <p>
    The conference will be held in Manchester New Hampshire from November 1st to 3rd.
    We are in the process of finalizing the venue.
  </p>

  <p>
    It will provide updates on NEARA's areas of focus over six decades, including land use in New England,
    the peopling of the Americas, ongoing research on Viking settlements in North America,
    and updates on indigenous archaeology and research efforts in the Northeast.
  </p>

  <p>
    NEARA Member Terry Deveau will present his research into William Goodwin, Malcolm Pearson, and the early owners of Mystery Hill.
  </p>

  <p>
    Martyn Whittock, historian and author known for his work on Viking history and mythology,
    including “American Vikings: How the Norse Sailed into the Lands and Imaginations of America,”
    will separate fact from fiction and explore the research of the Viking settlement of North America.
  </p>

  <p>
    The keynote Speaker will be Bruce Bradley, renowned researcher, archaeologist, and
    co-author of <a href="/sale.html#Stanford2013">Across Atlantic Ice</a>.
    He will share the latest evidence of human occupation in North and South America dating back 30,000 to 20,000 years.
