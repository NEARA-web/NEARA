  <h2>Rhode Island Chapter</h2>

    Rhode Island may be a small 
    state but it is rich in lithic features. Clusters of rockpiles are 
    spread throughout its conservation lands, petroglyphs and runes are 
    carved along its shores, and curiously propped boulders suggest that 
    more than nature was involved in the manipulation of the stone-filled 
    landscape.

  <h3>Newport Tower</h3>

  <p>
    The unusual arched architecture of the tower gracing Touro Park in Newport 
    has spawned considerable speculation on its origin and use. Historically
    known as the remains of a 17<sup>th</sup> century windmill constructed 
    by Governor Benedict Arnold, alternative proposals have conjured up 
    visits by Vikings, Medieval Norse, Portuguese, Templars, the Chinese and
    Basques. A nearby museum makes the case for a link to the Elizabethan 
    navigator and astronomer John Dee.

  <h3>Narragansett Stone</h3>

  <p>
    Long visible at low tide on the west side of Narragansett Bay, this boulder 
    contained engraved characters resembling Norse runes. Although difficult
    to date or authenticate, some accept the stone’s engravings as evidence
    for pre-Columbian Viking exploration of Rhode Island’s shoreline.

  <h3>Rockpiles</h3>

  <p>
    Clusters of stone piles can be found within the state’s conservation lands. Some
    may be remnants of Indian burial or prayer sites while others may be 
    the result of field clearing. Perhaps analysis of the distribution of 
    piles and research into historic land use may one day tease these 
    theories apart.
  </p>
    
  <h3>Eschoheag Propped Boulders</h3>

  <p>
    Glaciers may have left these large erratics perched in prominent locations, or 
    perhaps they were jockeyed into position by prehistoric peoples. Either 
    way, the pair of propped boulders peering from bedrock outcrops in 
    Eschoheag create an impressive image.
  </p>
    
  <h3>Symbol Rock, Yawgoog</h3>

  <p>
    Deep furrows in a boulder on the Scout Reservation have been interpreted by 
    some as Native American symbols, perhaps a tomahawk and arrowhead 
    signifying a hidden cache of weapons nearby. But like so many of 
    the other lithic features in Rhode Island, there are other possible 
    explanations, from a pioneer engraving to natural erosion of softer 
    veins in the stone.

  <h2>Triad of Technologies Webinar</h2>
  <p>
    We had a wonderful webinar on using relatively new technologies together for recording, preserving, and exploring sites:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>hand-held color LiDAR producing 3D point clouds (Tom Elmore, at Manitou Hassannash Preserve in Hopkinton RI)</li>
    <li>georeferencing that point cloud and importing it into a GIS application (Eva Gibavic, using ArcGIS)</li>
    <li>eventually using a 3D model with astronomy software for acheaoastronomy (Dave Gutkowski, at Council Rocks, using Stellarium)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The webinar happened on Friday 19 March 2021, but you can watch the recorded session at:
