<h2>EARLY STONE CAIRNS AND ROWS IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA</h2>

<p>Southwest of Allentown, Pennsylvania, on a wooded forty-plus acre ridge
site in the Oley Hills, is an impressive and unusual array of manmade stone
features that bears little relationship to any known colonial workmanship
or activity. These features consist of large and intricately constructed
cone-shaped and flat-topped cairns, oddly shaped stone rows, stone platforms,
a large stone terrace and ritualized boulders, made by either connecting
them with short stone rows, or else by piling small rocks on top of or
against them. The workmanship of many of these features is truly artistic
and awe inspiring.
</p>

<p>
The area in which the features occur was home to the Leni Lenapi of
the Algonqian Nation long before european settlers appeared.  By treaty
with the heirs of William Penn in 1732, the native inhabitants relinquished
title to the land and moved westward.  In their place came German
immigrants, who began to purchase land in the form of. Warrants beginning
in the mid-eighteenth century. Two families originally owned the forty-plus
acres, and plotting their land against existing stone walls reveals only
one wall that is contiguous with their property lines; the other walls,
of which there are many, do not coincide with them. The lack of old cart
paths on the property, pointed out to us by Dr. Michael Stewart, an archaeologist
at Temple University, implies that the stones comprising the features had
to be transported by hand to the various locations, a considerable undertaking.
We are presently researching old deeds, wills and local history in an attempt
to learn more about the history of the site and its inhabitants. Today,
three different families own portions the forty-acre parcel, and they wish
to restrict access to it. We are in accord with their wishes. However,
by posting images of some of the features found there, we hope to learn
whether similar structures have been found elsewhere in the Northeast.
A brief description of five of them follows. All features are of dry masonry
construction. With the exception of some cobbles of quartz incorporated
in the features, all of those described in this report are constructed
of gneiss, a native rock. Cobbles of quartz have yet to be found in the
area apart from the stone features.
</p>

<h4>Cone-Shaped Cairns</h4>

<p>
At the base of the ridge are four, intricately constructed, cone-shaped
cairns heavily encrusted with lichen. All are built on existing flat-topped
boulders. The one pictured below (Fig. 1) is 1.3m high and 1.5m wide, on
a boulder .7m high.

<p>
Because the base boulder is oval, the cairn looks pinched as viewed
from the side. Nearby is a similarly constructed cone-cairn 3m high, built
on a round boulder 1m high.
</p>

<h4>Central Ridge Map</h4>

<p>
In the fall and winter of 1997-98, Muller and Waltz surveyed the Central
Ridge site and produced a map, which is included in part as Fig. 2. Changes
in terminology have been noted in the text herein describing certain features.
The numerous small crosses (+) indicate small rude 'cairns'.

  </div>
</div>

<h4>Platform "B" and Large Boulder Areas</h4>

<p>
Halfway up the ridge, on a flat plateau, is a rectangular stone platform
(Platform "B"), measuring 6.7m x 3.3m, and between 1 and 2m high. Two other
platforms have been found on the site, one to the east and the other to
the west. Platform "B" is deemed important because of the fact that three
separate stone rows diverge no more than 3m from it, each oriented along
one of the main compass points. The row to the west seems to emerge from
the ground and soon meets a Large Inclined Cairn, 1.9m high and 4.5m long,
constructed on and against a large boulder. The north row does not engage
a boulder but simply curves and traces the ridge crest. Interestingly,
it has an unusual wedge-shaped cross-section, with its vertical face being
oriented to the east, and the tapered west-facing side consisting of a
backfill of large and small flat stones. A similarly constructed row continues
to the south, departing near the platform. It climbs up and over a rounded
ledge or boulder, and then abruptly turns to the west. At this point the
shape of the row changes, assuming a rounded cross-section and becoming
flat on top. This row then curves up the slope to the south, looping to
the west of a large, egg-shaped boulder (labeled "Erratic" on the map),
3m high and 4m long, on the flat-to-gently sloping summit, and ending in
a wide Row-Platform to its south-west. (Fig.3). We feel that this boulder
is the heart of the area that we call the Central Ridge.

  </div>
</div>

<h4>Stone Terrace</h4>

<p>
About 6m to the east and on the opposite side of the large boulder from
the Row-Platform is a flat-topped, curved feature that we call the Terrace
(Fig. 4 -- labeled "Parapet" on the map). It is approximately 2.5m high
and 12.7m long and projects 2m outward from the ridge crest. From the Terrace
the site slopes to the east, dropping 16m in 65m (25%) and then more gradually,
overlooking most of the previously mentioned features and the valley below.
The larger cobbles of gneiss are covered with smaller stones that we call
paving stones, undoubtedly to create a surface suitable for standing. Similar
small stones are found on two of the platforms and the row-platform mentioned
above. The proximity of the terrace to the large boulder and the row that
curves around it implies that its function is somehow tied in with them,
although we are unsure what this might be.

<h4>Curved Stone Row and Flat-Topped Cairn "A"</h4>

<p>
Just south of the large boulder, not more than fifteen meters away,
is a curved stone row that merges with an unusual looking, flat-topped
cairn (Fig. 5). Like the row that emerged from the ground in front of Platform
"B," this has a similar appearance, being .7m high and very compactly constructed.
It is one of many such unusual rows found at the site.

  </div>
</div>

<p>
From the side, one can see that this cairn, as with all the others,
is built against a large boulder, which is an integral part of it (Fig.
6). Cobbles of gneiss, 20-30cm across, comprise most of the structure,
with smaller pieces wedged in between. The cairn is 2.1m high and c.2.4m
long, contiguous with a boulder 1.5m high.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>
In our study of the features on the site, we have observed the following
characteristics about them:
</p><ol>
<li>
All cairns, whether those mentioned and illustrated in this report or not,
are constructed on existing boulders; none is placed directly on the ground.
Several smaller flat-topped cairns are found on the west slope side of
the ridge from those already mentioned, defining the opposite limit of
the approximately forty acre site.</li>

<li>
Many of the stone rows are curved, and many seem to go out of their way
to connect with large boulders, or lead to them. This is the same raison
d'etre that Philip Smith observed in his study of ancient stone walls in
northern Georgia, when he wrote: "one of the most striking features is
the apparent deliberate purposefulness by which large boulders and outcrops
were tied in with the walls. In some cases the walls seem to make deliberate
detours to link themselves with the larger rocks." ("Aboriginal Stone Construction
in the Southern Piedmont," <u>University of Georgia Laboratory of Archeology
Series</u>, Report No. 4, March 1962, pp. 1-47, esp. p. 34).</li>

<li>
The construction of those features illustrated is of very high quality,
indicating that considerable time was expended in their manufacture.</li>

<li>
None of the features appears to be defined by original Warrants and Surveys
dating to the mid-eighteenth century or by present property lines.</li>
</ol>
