    Often rough stones are laid out in circle, but their meaning is 
    unknown. Others more geometrically organized resemble western"medicine 
    wheels" and may also have astronomical alignments. This doublecircle 
    may have served a utilitarian need such as a grinding 
    trough. Stone seats maybe U shaped enclosures probably used for 
    vision quests, astonomical viewing, perhaps hunting blinds, or some 
    other unimagined purpose, while long rows or single large rocks 
    meadering willy-nilly through the wood may be very old for an unknown 
    purpose or simply "Colonial clutter."

    For many reasons there has been a paucity of in-depth analysis of the myriad of stonework remnants
    that exist on the rough terrain of the backlands of New England. Much of it is the work of 18th and
    19th century Euro-american farmers, such as walled field boundaries (Allport 1990), walled building
    foundations, and stone storage structures (Neudorfer 1980). Glacial debris abounds.
    There are, however, other enigmatic structures that remain unexplained. This discussion makes a case
    for Native American construction and use for one class of these, a “U”-shaped construct. The lack of
    analysis has deep roots. It originates in the Contact period Puritan colonists’ struggle to survive. It
    derives from their religious mindset (Fischer 1989) that resulted in laws banning the practice of Native
    American religion, and attitudes that strongly influenced historical scholarship into the 20th century
    (Jennings 1976). Added factors include the early disruption of Native American social structure due to the
    effects of imported diseases (Salisbury 1982), middle 17th century warfare (Jennings 1976), and academic
    paradigms such as “Indians of the Northeast did not use stone architecture” (Hall and Woodman 1972). The
    latter paradigm has served as a serious impediment to extensive professional involvement in an indepth
    evaluation of residual lithic structures in New England. It has contributed to minimizing
    meaningful dialogue.
