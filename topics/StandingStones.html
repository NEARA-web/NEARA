    Tall stones standing on the New England landscape memorialize 
    historic events as well as ordinary people. Tall stones serve as 
    cemetery monuments, boundary markers, gate posts and fence 
    supports. Standing stones have served as calendars in prehistoric 
    cultures. They have marked the progress of the solar year telling 
    agricultural people when to plant and had guided the organization of 
    their religious rites and festivals. There is a hill top right here in 
    New England the carries standing stones that mark the seasons.
