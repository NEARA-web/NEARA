  <h2>What does NEARA do?</h2>
  <p>
    Observant visitors to America's northeastern forests have long encountered various stone 
    structures. These include rock piles, stone chambers, unusual stone walls and circles,
    propped boulders, standing stones, petroglyphs, and stone or earthen 
    mounds. NEARA was founded in 1964 to promote research into the origins 
    and functions of these structures and sites, to document them and 
    encourage their protection and preservation. Volunteers participate in 
    the search for new sites and enjoy the challenge of better understanding 
    them through the lenses of history, archaeology, anthropology and 
    geology, as well as fields such as archaeoastronomy, deed research, and 
    epigraphy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our semiannual meetings provide an opportunity for sharing research on a wide array of 
    subjects, from the early peopling of the Americas, diffusion of cultural 
    features across oceans in antiquity, Native American traditions, to the 
    colonial period. Mythology, astronomy, comparative religion, 
    agricultural practices, landscape studies and remote sensing are all 
    areas we have explored. Our meetings and publications offer a forum for 
    studying these diverse subjects, in an effort to better understand our 
    region and its global context.

  <h2>Announcing the NEARA Forum</h2>

  </p>
  <p>
    Read about the details at <a href="/forum.html">The NEARA Forum</a>.

  <h2>NEARA Organization Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We are in the process of making some changes to how NEARA is structured.
  </p>
  <p>
    The NEARA Member Communications Committee includes not only the old Membership Committee,
    but also many other roles/groups that have substantial interactions with members.
    Unlike the Publications Committee, Member Communications subcommittees and roles will
    primarly communicate via the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    The First Vice President's many roles are now more explicitly spelled out,
    in the hopes of encouraging more people to help stage our conferences.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can see how NEARA is organized from the point of view of a typical NEARA member at:

  <h2>NEARA at Lehigh Valley events</h2>
  <p>
    By Jim Wilson
  </p>
  <p>
    NEARA helped sponsor four community events in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley in mid-March: at the
    <a href="https://watershedcoalitionlv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Indigenous-Perspectives-NNC.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lehigh Valley Watershed Conference</a> in Bethlehem PA, and the 
    <a href="https://watershedcoalitionlv.org/lehigh-valley-watershed-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Nurture Center</a> in Easton PA.
    In addition to NEARA's $1500 sponsorship, NEARA volunteers from PA, NJ, CT and RI helped plan and deliver these public programs
    and engaged with the many folks who stopped by NEARA's sponsorship table at each of the two venues where the four events were held on March 11-14.
    In total, about 300 people attended these four events and had access to NEARA's sponsorship table at all of them.
    Dozens of email addresses were collected and lots of NEARA literature were freely taken, including our spring conference registration materials.
  </p>
  <p>
    NEARA's sponsorship helped pay expenses for speakers to attend the events and address constructed cultural landscapes,
    the use of archaeology for land conservation with Indigenous tribes, and present a film screening and roundtable discussion about the award winning documentary,
    <i>"The Water Gap: Return to the Homeland"</i>.
    The film screening and roundtable was led by the Choctaw filmmaker and three young Delaware women, who were teenagers when the film was made in 2016.
