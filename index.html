  <h2>What does NEARA do?</h2>
  <p>
    Observant visitors to Americaâ€™s northeastern forests have long encountered various stone 
    structures. These include stone chambers, stone piles, unusual stone 
    walls and circles, propped boulders, petroglyphs and stone or earthen 
    mounds. NEARA was founded in 1964 to promote research into the origins 
    and functions of these structures and sites, to document them and 
    encourage their protection and preservation. Volunteers participate in 
    the search for new sites and enjoy the challenge of better understanding 
    them through the lenses of history, archaeology, anthropology and 
    geology, as well as fields such as archaeoastronomy, deed research, and 
    epigraphy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our semiannual meetings provide an opportunity for sharing research on a wide array of 
    subjects, from the early peopling of the Americas, diffusion of cultural 
    features across oceans in antiquity, Native American traditions, to the 
    colonial period. Mythology, astronomy, comparative religion, 
    agricultural practices, landscape studies and remote sensing are all 
    areas we have explored. Our meetings and publications offer a forum for 
    studying these diverse subjects, in an effort to better understand our 
    region and its global context.

  <h2>Triad of Technologies Webinar</h2>
  <p>
    We had a wonderful webinar on using relatively new technologies together for recording, preserving, and exploring sites:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>hand-held color LiDAR producing 3D point clouds (Tom Elmore, at Manitou Hassannash Preserve)</li>
    <li>georeferencing that point cloud and importing it into a GIS application (Eva Gibavic, using ArcGIS)</li>
    <li>eventually using a 3D model with astronomy software for archeaoastronomy (Dave Gutkowski, at Council Rocks, using Stellarium)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The webinar happened on Friday 19 March 2021, but you can watch the recorded session at:

  <h2>Jim Wilson on Constructed Stone Landscapes in Pennsylvania</h2>
  <p>
    Jim Wilson made a great presentation to the Watershed Coalition of the Lehigh Valley.  You can view it on Facebook at:
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/146334712442984/videos/2834092913546251" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Mysteries of Constructed Stone Landscapes</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jim Wilson adds: "I would like to correct an error in my presentation.
    It was local avocational archeologist Ed Henning who was the champion of,
    and deserves the credit for the recording of the Pocono Creek Watershed CSL in Monroe County with the PA State Historic Preservation Office.
    I mistakenly cited Ed Lenik in my talk. My apologies to Mr. Henning for that misattribution."

  <h2>Research at New Hampshire Sites</h2>
  <p>
    The Research Committee and the New Hampshire State Archaeologist are conducting excavations at sites in New Hampshire.
    The sites in Hillsborough and Deerfield each have a variety of interesting stone structures.
    We have performed both sedimentary OSL dating and rock surface OSL dating at these sites.
    Some laboratory analysis will happen soon, but results may depend on waiting a year to get better dosimeter readings
    from where the samples were taken in the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is an article about the research in the April 2021 <i>Transit</i>.

  <h2>Update on NEARA's OSL Dating Project</h2>
  <p>
    NEARA is conducting an ambitious project to use OSL dating at many well-known sites throughout the Northeast.
