  <h2>Candidates for the NEARA Board</h2>

  <h4 class="person" id="SydneyBlackwell">Sydney Blackwell</h4>
  <div class="bio">
    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Like most NEARA members, Sydney Blackwell came to NEARA with the question, “WHAT ARE THESE?” Also, like most new members, she quickly learned there are no easy answers but found that unknowns and the people pursuing them can be as interesting. She has since been on the Journal team for several years and is currently completing her first term as a NEARA director-at-large.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first vice president's primary role is program chair for “the General Meeting,” aka conferences. Sydney would bring to that role experience as past-president of Friends of Pine Hawk, an Acton, Massachusetts-based group that has been offering archaeology and Indigenous culture-related programs for over 20 years. She would also bring experience from her previous life in journalism and project management, with interests in historical research, art, and visual design. In particular, she would like to help new members navigate NEARA’s knowledge base, site investigation fundamentals, and ethical standards, while continuing NEARA’s commitment to bring recent research and ideas to the conferences. There are many, many talented NEARA members and her priority would be to engage as many NEARA members as possible in the program work of the organization.

      <p>
        Thomas (Tom) Elmore is a historical landscape architect by training with more than 38 years of professional experience.  He currently runs two small businesses- one focuses on landscape architecture and the other on 3D LiDAR scanning and mapping.  He first became aware of ceremonial stone structures and landscapes in early 2019. Since then, he has applied his skill sets to documenting them at various locations from Maine to Pennsylvania, and New York to Rhode Island. Tom enjoys collaborating with property owners and lead investigators and gains valuable information from their knowledge each time.  Tom believes that NEARA offers a great deal to the community with its research, membership, and organization.  He has enjoyed being a member, a Director-at-Large, and part of the Research Committee and looks forward to continuing in these roles for another two years.

  <h4 class="person" id="FrederickMartin">Frederick Martin</h4>
  <div class="bio">
    <span class="text">
      <p>
        My personal passion for archaeoastronomy, particularly in ceremonial stone landscapes, has been reflected in 16 contributed talks, invited presentations, and peer-reviewed articles. I am committed to facilitating planned group visits to stone sites to foster cultural appreciation. Additionally, I advocate for individual member involvement in exploration, mapping, and recording of sites as volunteers.
      </p>
      <p>
        My academic journey began with a Ph.D. in physics and culminated in my tenure as a research professor at the University of Maryland's Graduate School of Physics. Following my academic career, I ventured into entrepreneurship as the founder and president of a small scientific enterprise. Under my leadership, the company secured federally funded research contracts, resulting in numerous publications and patents. At the age of 88, I am currently retired. Together with my wife Elizabeth (Beppy), I have a son, a daughter, and two grandchildren.
      </p>
      <p>
        If elected, I will offer my assistance to NEARA in effectively managing its endowment income. I further propose to contribute to NEARA by serving on the research committee as a reviewer and participating in policy formation as a voting director-at-large. Drawing from my extensive experience as one of the organization's senior members, I pledge to support subsurface exploration by NEARA-supported, professionally certified archaeologists.

      </p>
      <p>
        If elected, Matt would like to help NEARA realize more mainstream awareness of its key research initiatives that shed new light on our understanding of regional stone features. As an active outdoorsman and explorer, he would also like to contribute to the organization’s database of site documentation and provide thoughtful perspective on past and future research projects.

  <h4 class="person" id="MartinRapp">Martin Rapp</h4>
  <div class="bio">
    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Having been involved in NEARA for seven years, Martin Rapp is seeking the elected office position of Second Vice President. He previously served NEARA in a shortened term as Director-at-Large and currently serves on NEARA’s Nominating Committee. In addition, he has given three NEARA conference presentations and led NEARA field trips.  A retired wildlife biologist living in New Jersey, Martin has served with various non-profit organizations, including time as president of Friends of Howell Living History Farm, as board member for Hunterdon Land Trust, as well as volunteering at his local historical society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using LiDAR imaging, Martin has identified, made field inspections, and documented more than one hundred ceremonial stone landscape (CSL) sites in northern New Jersey.  He is pleased to have shared all these locations with the Ramapough Lenape-Turtle Clan and continues to regularly update and offer his assistance to the Turtle Clan.  Martin has also made strong and positive contacts with the NJ SHPO and NJ State Museum. His written documentation and site records of important CSL sites have been accepted and recorded by both these agencies. As Second Vice President and as part of NEARA’s objective to educate its membership, Martin hopes to offer encouragement and support to state chapters coordinators with the aim to bolster field trips and programing. Furthermore, he would like to see NEARA stimulate positive dialogue with all state SHPO and THPO to facilitate site reporting and data/information exchange on all aspects of NEARA study and interests.

  <h4 class="person" id="WaltervanRoggen">Walter van Roggen</h4>
  <div class="bio">
    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Walter van Roggen is a founder of a software company. He currently serves as chair of the NEARA Library and Archives Committee and acts as Archivist, Secretary, and Webmaster. He was chair of the Research and Special Projects Committee and conference A/V person for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walter has spent his time at NEARA moving the organization into the 21st century; he is the creator of SiteDB.org and led the effort to digitize NEARA’s site files and archives.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If elected, I intend to transform NEARA into a more interactive and internet-oriented organization while maintaining our focus on understanding and preserving lithic features in North America.  We digitized the Archive's Site Files and made them available to NEARA members at sitedb.org, but there is so much more we can do!  Presently members submit files via email to sites@neara.org, but I intend for you to be able to do this interactively online.  We also want to integrate information from other sources on the web into the database.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are now maintaining the NEARA Calendar, at neara.org/calendar, listing events that are of interest to you, and letting you subscribe to our calendar; send us events at calendar@neara.org.  We could also sponsor more online presentations via Zoom.  We have seen some interest in selling newly-released books and reviving the conference Book Table, but the Book Table could continue year-around online; if interested, send email to librarian@neara.org.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going on field trips and meeting like-minded people in person is still the heart of the NEARA experience, so I am hoping we can organize more field trips open to all NEARA members.  Not everyone can attend every field trip, so I would also like to see more videos, made by you and shared with everyone, either via Zoom meetings or in-person at conferences.  We could also form special interest groups about specific topics that you want to learn and do.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these ideas and many more can only be achieved when you help to make them real.  I'd like to know what you want to do.  How can I help?”
