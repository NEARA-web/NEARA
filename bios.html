      <p>
        Betsy discovered NEARA in 1990 after she and her husband bought land on Onion Mtn Ridge in CT, built a house, and began exploring the area.
        The property faces Talcott Mtn ridge, has a year-round view of sunrises, and is dotted with dramatic boulders, outcroppings, stone piles,
        and alignments to Solstice & Equinox points across the valley.
        Friends who visited were inspired by this site, but a geologist and earth science teacher friend insisted “you must read Manitou!”.
      </p>
      <p>
        He pointed out many features on the property that were invisible to untrained eyes, and he offered his copy of the Mavor/Dix book.
        That changed everything and put Betsy on a path to learn and understand more about her property and tap into the network of people
        who deal with the many aspects of ceremonial landscape and have stories to tell. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Betsy found and joined NEARA.
        She then brought pictures and a map of her property to the next NEARA Conference and showed them to a group of members and began to
        get feedback and encouragement along with names of people, books, and other locations that would put her property into perspective.
        She believes it was, and still is, one of the best qualities of NEARA meetings.
        After some time away from NEARA, Betsy has returned to the NEARA Board to help plan conferences as she did 30 years ago.
        Starting with the historic 3-day 1992 ABC Conference (America Before Columbus) at Brown Univ, Betsy’s involvement in NEARA during
        that decade grew stronger to the point of helping set up meeting programs and venues as NEARA’s 1st VP, serving from 2000-2007. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Ten years later, it was a particular pleasure for Betsy to help design the ABC+10 conference in 2002, with another 3-day program.
        Planners made every effort to engage significant speakers (international as well as Smithsonian researchers) as well as bringing
        back a sizable number of the original ABC speakers who had expanded their research and were eager to report their new findings. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Betsy is enthusiastic about NEARA’s leadership, its evolving and changing membership, and the new path it is taking with research as a focus.
        From a somewhat global view she remembers in past years, she believes NEARA has brought a greater awareness to northeast indigenous sites,
        ceremonial stone landscapes, and local history.
        She hopes to do her part in keeping conference venues all they should be to make a full weekend stimulating and worthwhile.

    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Terry J. Deveau works for Jasco Applied Sciences as Senior Scientist – Ocean Acoustics.
        He graduated from Penn State University with an MS in Acoustics in 1999.
        His specialty is computer models of underwater sound.
        He has been employed in scientific software development since his university undergraduate days in 1974, and in the past has worked
        for Unysis, MacDonald Dettwiler, and the Government of Canada.
        He also has a BSc in mathematics, a diploma in engineering, and has done work at the graduate level in astrophysics.
        Terry has taught object-oriented computer programming at the university level.
        Terry served as NEARA president for six years (2012-04-21 to 2018-04-18) and is now serving NEARA as 2nd Vice-President
        and Chapter Coordinator for Atlantic Canada.
        He also serves with the NEARA editorial team on the publications committee and assists with website development.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his spare time, Terry has been a life-long student of history, geology, archaeology, mathematics, physics, and astronomy.
        He is active in exploring and investigating unusual stone structures and petroglyphs in remote areas of the Northeast,
        but especially his home Province of Nova Scotia, Canada.
        Terry’s French Acadian ancestors have lived in Acadia (now the Maritime Provinces of Canada) since about 1690.
        Their stories, genealogy, and Acadian history in general are a particular passion for Terry.
        He also has a great interest in the records (oral, written, stone-built, and archaeological) of the early people of the Northeast,
        including the indigenous native people as well as those who came here from distant lands (British, French, Portuguese, Basque, and Norse).
        Terry has appeared in the role of historical consultant on the reality TV series “Curse of Oak Island” on a number of occasions,
        as well as on a CBC documentary program
        <a href="http://www.telltale.tv/shows/maritime-vignettes/stories-stone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Land and Sea</i></a> about the Yarmouth Runic Stone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terry is active in the exploration, documentation, and preservation of ancient stone and earthwork structures in the Northeast,
        particularly those that are not presently adequately understood or documented.
        Although he has undertaken such projects in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, PEI, Newfoundland, and Labrador,
        his main activities are focused in his home province of Nova Scotia.
        His biggest project to-date is the archaeological recognizance survey of the Chain Lakes Watershed, which includes the Bayer’s Lake Mystery Walls.

      <p>
        Teresa Bierce spent the last 20 years as an Operations Manager for a Healthcare Recruiting firm in Westchester County New York.
        She specialized in database management for the past 30 years and managed many databases from health club members to guide dog puppies to doctors and surgeons.
        Teresa wears many hats on the NEARA Board.
        As the Membership Chair she manages the database of NEARA Members,
        administers the ballots for annual elections, and provides various administrative tasks.
        She now produces the Transit and acts as Registrar for conferences.
        She was the Secretary of NEARA for eleven years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teresa has been a NEARA Member since 2007.
        Living most of her life in Putnam County New York it is no wonder that her main area of interest and research has been Stone Chambers.
        She spent twelve years hiking through the woods and driving around the area “Chamber Hunting” then documenting her finds.
        Now that she is retired Teresa has the time to spend organizing her field notes, compiling her research, and databasing all the Stone Chambers she documented.
      </p>
      <p>
        In November 2019 Teresa and her husband John, along with their poodles Jack and Lucy, left the great northeast and moved to sunny Florida.
        She is still continually active in NEARA and found her new state to have a rich history of indigenous peoples.
        A famous archeological dig only a few miles from her home, The Old Vero Site, is the first on her list of interests with many other sites in the state to explore.
        Teresa is looking forward to this new and exciting adventure and will share her discoveries with NEARA Members as they unfold.

    <img class="portrait" src="/bios/GARY ALICANDRO PHOTO.jpg">
    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Gary Alicandro has over 40 years of professional experience in environmental science and technology and safety regulatory programs
        in roles as a project manager, team leader, inspector, environmental engineer and technical specialist working for industry,
        military and consulting firms including specialized work overseas.
        His project experiences include phased environmental investigations of contaminated sites and transportation corridors;
        construction earthwork management; inspection audits; hazardous waste site investigations and remediation cleanups;
        hazardous chemical materials management; emergency chemical spill response; training; safety plans; preparation of operating procedures
        and technical specifications; documentation, recordkeeping and technical report preparation.
        Project experiences also include liaison roles with local and federal government agencies.
        He has actively participated on numerous professional organization committees supporting education and professional development,
        served as an adjunct college environmental instructor, conducted numerous nationwide professional seminars and received
        professional certifications and registrations.
        </p>
      <p>
        Gary has extensive experience in conducting site reconnaissance surveys, research, and systematic environmental site investigations.
        These have involved abandoned and complex tracts requiring historical research into ownership, land use practices, identification of
        soil and artificial fill characteristics, use of remote sensing imagery and surficial and bedrock geology.
        For projects investigating human-caused impacts and natural alterations of a site, he values phased systematic approaches that
        examine and integrate multiple factors that contribute to the environmental and cultural setting under review.
        He also has experience in the application of field investigation techniques involving nonintrusive and intrusive subsurface investigations,
        collection and handling of soil samples, geophysical techniques, and selection of laboratory methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether solo or with family and friends, Gary enjoys hiking, backpacking, and camping with a particular interest in the exploration
        of wilderness areas that are remote, unique, undisturbed, and mountainous.
        During these various excursions, he appreciates the exchange of insights of encountered observations of unusual, weathered boulder
        arrangements, geologic features and natural formations that suggest patterns of historical cultural adaptation and use.
        Gary is an avid explorer of interesting natural environmental and geologic landforms and their spatial geographic interrelationships
        with past human activity.
        In particular, he focuses on the investigation of modified landform features and crafted structural stonework formations in landscapes
        that strongly suggest a venerated purpose and intended design by ancient indigenous builders.
        A few years ago, during research of a particular curious observation, he noticed a reference to NEARA in a publication.
        He subsequently joined as a result because he wanted to volunteer in an organization with a meaningful vision and expand his
        participation into the research of ancient periods, mysterious relics, and existence of diverse indigenous roots of the
        northeast/mid-Atlantic areas.
        As such, Gary is drawn to the mystery and intent of past cultures to express complex harmonious relationships with nature and
        integrate belief systems around natural stone features and crafted lithic structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gary is an active volunteer with the American Red Cross and serves as a local and national Disaster Action Team Responder.
        He recently deployed to Florida in the Fall 2022 to support relief operations in response to Hurricane Ian.
        In addition, he is a community presenter for the “Be Red Cross Ready” program specializing in emergency preparedness and planning.
        Gary has a B.S. Degree in Environmental Studies (Springfield College) and a M.S. Degree in Environmental Management
        (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute).

      <p>
        Although Susan Blackstone is not a native Vermonter, she has spent most of her adult life in the far northeast hills of Vermont and
        likes to refer to herself as a transplant.
        She came to Vermont in the 70’s as part of the “Back to the Land Movement”.
        She studied video production, acting, and photography in college and had a professional background in sales and marketing within the publishing industry
        before becoming interested in holistic healing modalities.
        She is a Nationally Certified Reflexologist and Teacher and operates a small holistic center and Airbnb out of her home in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont.
        She is currently the Vermont State Coordinator and an active member of the NEARA Library Committee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Susan was first introduced to the mysterious concept of an Ancient Vermont in the early 80’s when some friends showed her photographs
        of standing stones and stone chambers around central Vermont.
        After visiting a stone chamber known as Calendar Two “It was love at first site” and she was determined to learn more about this fascinating subject.
        While working for the American Society of Dowsers she discovered a copy of the NEARA Transit at their bookstore
        and contacted the then chapter coordinator, Lisa Gannon.
        Lisa was leading some summer field trips at the time and introduced her to an old time NEARA Member Ernie Clifford.
        Susan had the opportunity to visit many lesser known sites around central Vermont with Ernie and Lisa and attended her first
        NEARA Conference in New Hampshire in 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past year, Susan has been working on organizing the NEARA VT files by county and matching up old site reports with new and updated materials.
        She has also been active in working on the library database and familiarizing herself with the NEARA Library’s unusual and unique contents.
        She is an avid travel photographer with a keen interest in Ancient Civilizations.
        She is working on a photo journal of her many trips to the megalithic sites she has visited in Mexico, Aruba, the UK, India, and Egypt.
        Her plans for the NEARA Vermont Chapter are to arrange small field trips this summer and fall to some of the lesser known sites around the state.
        She is also interested in engaging her chapter members by means of online meetings.
        She is honored to serve NEARA as the Vermont Chapter Coordinator and is looking forward to a more socially interactive year ahead.

      <p>
        Nancy Berke was introduced to NEARA when attending the annual American Society of Dowsers conferences in Vermont.
        She found that her curiosity about archaeoastronomy, earth mysteries, earth energies, and
        stone circle sites was shared by members of an interesting organization called NEARA.
        Members of ASD and NEARA were similarly intrigued by the compelling research being done at local calendar sites,
        specifically Calendar One, Calendar Two, and America’s Stonehenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having been drawn to the study of megalithic sites in Europe, it was joining NEARA in 2006 that served to expand
        Nancy’s horizons in a number of fascinating areas including:
        ancient civilizations and ancient sea peoples; early trans-oceanic travel and exploration; archaeoacoustics of stone age temples of Malta;
        the theory of diffusionist culture; the Solutrean hypothesis; Viking exploration in North America;
        the mound builders of the mid-west and earthwork remnants that remain such as Cahokia and Serpent Mound; and
        the pervasive rock piles, standing stones, chambers and propped boulders of New England with their similarities to lithic structures throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nancy became a Director-at-Large in 2007 and her primary contributions to NEARA have been as Conference Book Table Coordinator
        and member/Chairperson of the Library and Archives Committee.
        Since 2015, she has been closely involved with the relocation and reorganization of the Library as well as with the creation of
        a new online database for the book collection.
        Nancy is always happy to meet members at the Library in Nashua, NH to help facilitate the borrowing and purchasing of books.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being involved with the Library and the Book Table for 14 years has allowed her to recognize and appreciate the wide-ranging interests of the NEARA membership.
        She values the members’ unique perspectives of focus and study in the realm of antiquity, both historic and Neolithic,
        and enjoys learning from them about the enigmatic stone structures which provide the thread that binds their interests together.

        David Brody is the author of 13 novels, most of which focus on sites and artifacts in New England evidencing exploration of America before Columbus.
        He has appeared as a guest expert on documentaries airing on History Channel, Discovery, Travel Channel, PBS, and the Science Channel.
        A graduate of Tufts University and Georgetown Law School, David first served on the NEARA Board in 2007-2010 and has now returned for a second term.
      </p>
      <p>
        A longtime resident of Westford, Massachusetts, David first joined NEARA in 2006 as a result of his interest in the Westford Knight
        and Westford Boat Stone carvings.
        His children call him a “rock nerd” because of the time he spends exploring stone carvings and chambers around New England.
        One of his favorite locations is America’s Stonehenge, where you can often find him on solstice and equinox sunrises and sunsets
        observing the various astronomical alignments.
        You can also be sure to find him at the Newport Tower on the morning of the winter solstice observing the fascinating “keystone orb”
        illumination—he has not missed this event in 13 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        David now resides in Newburyport Massachusetts with his wife, sculptor Kimberly Scott.
        He spends much of his time traveling the country and visiting Europe to view ancient megalithic sites, which he then incorporates into his novels.
        These novels tend to focus on one key question: Did ancient peoples visit America before Columbus?
        It is a question that keeps David—and many other NEARA members—up at night.

      <p>
        Dave Gutkowski is a successful storage business owner, licensed private pilot, licensed massage therapist,
        accomplished Reiki master, and amateur astronomer from Ashley, PA.
        He attended Bishop Hoban High School and Penn State University where he studied Mechanical Engineering.
        Upon graduation Dave took a job with the US Postal Service, and during his 30-year career worked every job available in order to continue learning.
        Dave officially retired from the USPS in 2009 as postmaster of Shawanese, PA where he met his partner Carla.  
      </p>
      <p>
        After discovering a curiously arranged collection of large boulders on a mountaintop meadow in 2004 Dave’s interest in stone landscapes was born.
        He felt drawn to the boulders he called ‘Council Rocks’ and joined NEARA in 2007.
        That year, and with the help of veteran member Fred Martin, he found the uniquely shaped boulders to be perfectly aligned with both solstice and equinox events.
        Using his astronomy background, he successfully researched, documented and established the site as a potential late-archaic
        archaeoastronomy site with the PA Historic Preservation Office.
        He was awarded an official site designation from the SHPO in 2011 and presented his findings on Council Rocks at a NEARA conference in 2012.
        He continues his research at the Council Rocks site and nearby Alpenglow Rockshelter for which he also received a site designation from the SHPO in 2019.
        Dave was invited to serve on the NEARA board and as PA Coordinator in 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dave and Carla currently reside in Bear Creek, PA surrounded by pets and wildlife and have been known to hand-feed visiting raccoons and white-tailed deer.
        They love hiking and nature photography.
        His work over the past decade has led to giving presentations on both sites at numerous archaeology conferences in PA, NY, and VA,
        as well as meetings for avocational groups within the region and at the AAPS annual meetings in Michigan.
        Recent work on the mountain includes large area LiDAR scans and ground-penetrating radar scans at the rockshelter.
        Both have produced even more sites and findings of interest.
        He hopes to bring his decades of learning and astronomy skills to help research and further document alignments for many long-standing NEARA projects.

        Eventually Jim became part of a team of specialists who traveled internationally to install communication equipment.
        In civilian clothes Jim worked for several high-tech companies until he was accepted by the University of R.I. to pursue a degree in Industrial Engineering.
        Jim has been a member of NEARA since 2015.
        He lived in many states across America and has always been interested in hiking and exploring the natural world for as long as he can remember.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past ten years Jim’s interest in indigenous lithic creations became a passion.
        Dr. Curtis Hoffman’s research project of indigenous lithic stone sites along the eastern seaboard propelled Jim to search for and record the same
        in his hometown of Hopkinton, MA and his family home in Denning, NY.
        Jim’s efforts to protect indigenous lithic sites forged collaborations with Doug Harris the recently retired Deputy Tribal Historic Preservation Officer,
        Cathy Taylor the Steward of Upton, MA Chamber & Narragansett Indian Tribal Historic Preservation Trust, and Eva Gibavic of Ceremonial Landscapes Research LLC.
        Jim co-hosted two Ceremonial Stone Landscape presentations for the Hopkinton Public Library and the Hopkinton Historical Society with Doug Harris.
        Jim and Doug Harris worked with the Hopkinton Planning Board to ensure that a solar company protected Ceremonial Stone features,
        which Jim discovered and recorded, on land they leased in Hopkinton.

        As an avid history buff Tom joined the Westford Knight Committee in the 1980’s.
        He was on the Westford Planning Board, the Conservation Commission, and he helped start and run the local Land Trust.
        His work eventually brought him to Madison CT in 1995.
      </p>
      <p>
        After discussing the interesting stonework around his new home in Madison CT, Tom’s friend Norman Biggart told him about NEARA and their interest in lithic sites.
        He joined NEARA in 1997 and started to research the many stone piles in the open space nearby his home and on his property.
        He became the NEARA Treasurer in 1998 and held that position for 22 years.
        Being on the Madison Wetland Board and the Land Trust Board he walked much of the open space in his town.
        After being on a NEARA Conference Field Trip Tom started to look for stone structure alignments on his hikes through the woods and
        soon discovered a summer solstice alignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tom has been studying this alignment for more than 23 years and named it The Hammonasset Line after the Native American Tribe who lived in the area in the 1700’s.
        The line consists of one stone complex after another starting at a huge quartzite boulder at Fort Hill Cemetery in Montauk NY and
        extends through the Catskill Mountains to Devil’s Tombstone in Hunter NY.
        If you extend the line further, it goes to an area in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula know for its ancient copper mines.
        Tom is long retired and is still hard at work researching his intriguing discovery.

        Frederick W. Martin earned his doctorate in physics at Yale University in 1964.
        After a stint in commercial semiconductor research, he served at universities located in Europe, Kentucky, and Maryland where
        he taught classes and led research into atomic collisions at high velocities funded by the National Science Foundation.
        Subsequently he founded two small research companies using such collisions in microscopy,
        leading to more NSF support, patents, more publications, and a specialized lens sold worldwide before retirement in 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1975 he read the works of the British professor Alexander Thom, especially his book Megalithic Lunar Observatories,
        and began fieldwork in archaeology as an avocation.
        Like Byron Dix, he set out to find stone remains in New England.
        With wife Beppy and young children he made many weekend visits to walking sites with names retaining the Puritan association
        of Native American meeting places with devil worship, or with the name of the Wampanoag tribe leader “King Philip.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This led to much work on King Philip’s Rocks in Sharon MA, including a GPS survey with the town conservation agent,
        an early oral report at the NEARA 2001 Fall Meeting, preservation of 150 acres by town meeting votes,
        two articles in the Bulletin of the Massachusetts Archaeological Society with Ted Ballard and Jim Mavor,
        another oral report on the Archaic date of the site (by Lockyer’s method) at a combined NEARA/MAS meeting,
        and a certificate of appreciation from the Sharon Friends of Conservation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first NEARA report led to published work with Polly Midgley, Beppy Martin, and Walter Wheeler on the possible sightings of the setting sun and
        moon as seen from the semicircular plaza in front of the Kings Chamber in Putnam Valley NY.
        Realization of the opportunity to do OSL dating during repair of the Upton Chamber for public safety reasons led to published work with Cathy Taylor
        which proved for the first time that a chamber was constructed prior to European settlement.
        Much more still unpublished work on sightlines at the Balanced Rock in Canton MA, which face southwards where the moon cannot rise,
        has led to identification of sightlines to the ends of the Milky Way on the horizon, both at Canton and larger sites such as Newark, Ohio,
        Lizard Mounds, Wisconsin, and Chimney Rock, Colorado.

        In 2008, during a trip to visit family in Ireland, Dyane was taken to an ancient site that had a round stone tower.
        While reviewing her vacation pictures she conducted an internet search of the tower and wondered about stone sites in America.
        The search led Dyane to the Newport Tower on NEARA’s website.
        A few weeks later she attended her first NEARA Conference and her eyes were opened to the many varieties of stone sites that
        populate Putnam County, she soon became a NEARA Member.
        This led to many years of hiking through the woods discovering, documenting, and researching stone sites throughout New York and New England.
