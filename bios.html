    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Harvey Buford’s career is in construction.
        This includes project management of subways, power plants and such before operating a carpentry and home improvement business and
        serving as the local Building and Zoning Official.
        Harvey holds a B.S. in Building Construction from his native Louisiana.
        He chaired his town’s Conservation Commission for over 25 years establishing the town land trust, various ordinances,
        advising on legislation, and many development projects.
        He has served on the boards of environmental and farm organizations often as treasurer.
        Harvey has constructed 20 miles of new trails on preserved lands.
        Many of his trails pass through Native American ceremonial stone landscapes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harvey first met NEARA in 2014 when they supported the purchase and preservation of a local stone complex slated for construction, now Manitou Hassannash Preserve.
        He served as Rhode Island Coordinator and then chaired the new Finance Committee and developed improved budgeting and oversight.
        He was elected the NEARA President in 2018.
        He wishes to educate decision makers and the public about preserving the ancient Native American stone presence in our woods.
        He has a vision of NEARA supporting new technology and scientific investigations of sites to better determine their purpose and age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harvey is currently involved with a historic survey and inventory at Manitou Hassannash Preserve funded by the National Park Service, the RI Historic Preservation,
        and the Heritage Commission to appoint the preserve to the National Register as an Indigenous Ceremonial Stone Landscape of the Northeast.
        He hopes this will help correct the past professional disinterest in Native American history.
        He would like to develop and implement aggressive management plans to limit the high rate of damage and loss to stone landscapes from
        trees growing up through the structures and falling down upon them.

    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Terry J. Deveau works for Jasco Applied Sciences as Senior Scientist – Ocean Acoustics.
        He graduated from Penn State University with an MS in Acoustics in 1999.
        His specialty is computer models of underwater sound.
        He has been employed in scientific software development since his university undergraduate days in 1974, and in the past has worked
        for Unysis, MacDonald Dettwiler, and the Government of Canada.
        He also has a BSc in mathematics, a diploma in engineering, and has done work at the graduate level in astrophysics.
        Terry has taught object-oriented computer programming at the university level.
        Terry served as NEARA president for six years (2012-04-21 to 2018-04-18) and is now serving NEARA as 2nd Vice-President
        and Chapter Coordinator for Atlantic Canada.
        He also serves with the NEARA editorial team on the publications committee and assists with website development.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his spare time, Terry has been a life-long student of history, geology, archaeology, mathematics, physics, and astronomy.
        He is active in exploring and investigating unusual stone structures and petroglyphs in remote areas of the Northeast,
        but especially his home Province of Nova Scotia, Canada.
        Terry’s French Acadian ancestors have lived in Acadia (now the Maritime Provinces of Canada) since about 1690.
        Their stories, genealogy, and Acadian history in general are a particular passion for Terry.
        He also has a great interest in the records (oral, written, stone-built, and archaeological) of the early people of the Northeast,
        including the indigenous native people as well as those who came here from distant lands (British, French, Portuguese, Basque, and Norse).
        Terry has appeared in the role of historical consultant on the reality TV series “Curse of Oak Island” on a number of occasions,
        as well as on a CBC documentary program
        <a href="http://www.telltale.tv/shows/maritime-vignettes/stories-stone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Land and Sea</i></a> about the Yarmouth Runic Stone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terry is active in the exploration, documentation, and preservation of ancient stone and earthwork structures in the Northeast,
        particularly those that are not presently adequately understood or documented.
        Although he has undertaken such projects in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, PEI, Newfoundland, and Labrador,
        his main activities are focused in his home province of Nova Scotia.
        His biggest project to-date is the archaeological recognizance survey of the Chain Lakes Watershed, which includes the Bayer’s Lake Mystery Walls.

      <p>
        Teresa Bierce spent the last 20 years as an Operations Manager for a Healthcare Recruiting firm in Westchester County New York.
        She specialized in database management for the past 30 years and managed many databases from health club members to guide dog puppies to doctors and surgeons.
        Teresa wears many hats on the NEARA Board.
        As the Membership Chair she manages the database of NEARA Members, as the Nominating Committee Chair she recruits members for NEARA Board positions,
        and as the NEARA Secretary she supports the President, administers the ballots for annual elections, and provides various administrative tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teresa has been a NEARA Member since 2007.
        Living most of her life in Putnam County New York it is no wonder that her main area of interest and research has been Stone Chambers.
        She spent twelve years hiking through the woods and driving around the area “Chamber Hunting” then documenting her finds.
        Now that she is retired Teresa has the time to spend organizing her field notes, compiling her research, and databasing all the Stone Chambers she documented.
      </p>
      <p>
        In November 2019 Teresa and her husband John, along with their poodles Jack and Lucy, left the great northeast and moved to sunny Florida.
        She is still continually active in NEARA and found her new state to have a rich history of indigenous peoples.
        A famous archeological dig only a few miles from her home, The Old Vero Site, is the first on her list of interests with many other sites in the state to explore.
        Teresa is looking forward to this new and exciting adventure and will share her discoveries with NEARA Members as they unfold.

    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Dyane Plunkett worked in a special education preschool as an Early Childhood Educator with children, birth to five,
        before receiving her master’s degree in 2007 in Communications Disorders.
        Since joining NEARA she led many field trips, joined several committees, and even tackled the conference registration table.
        She also served as the Western Connecticut Chapter Coordinator.
        Dyane sits on the Membership and Library Committees and as a member of the Nominating Committee she recruits members for NEARA Board positions
        and helps to fill committee seats.
        She was the Finance Committee Chair in 2018 and 2019 conducting and reporting financial reviews of the Treasurer’s accounting.
        She was recently appointed as the new NEARA Treasurer and is a member of a newly formed financial strategy group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dyane grew up in Connecticut and spent her vacations visiting her grandparent’s dairy farm in Putnam County NY.
        Nearby was a stone chamber she always wondered about.
        When she asked her relatives what it was, the response was always the same “they stored ammunition in there”.
        Twenty-five years ago she moved her family to the farm and soon become a Trustee of the Patterson Historical Society and joined the Putnam County Land Trust.
        But it wasn’t until 2008 that Dyane finally got some answers to her questions concerning the neighboring stone chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2008, during a trip to visit family in Ireland, Dyane was taken to an ancient site that had a round stone tower.
        While reviewing her vacation pictures she conducted an internet search of the tower and wondered about stone sites in America.
        The search led Dyane to the Newport Tower on NEARA’s website.
        A few weeks later she attended her first NEARA Conference and her eyes were opened to the many varieties of stone sites that
        populate Putnam County, she soon became a NEARA Member.
        This led to many years of hiking through the woods discovering, documenting, and researching stone sites throughout New York and New England.
        Dyane now lives in Rhode Island and continues her search for stone sites and is involved in efforts to preserve Ceremonial Stone Landscapes.

      <p>
        After finding an interesting rock pile on his own in the woods, Walter learned about NEARA from a friend, George Krusen.
        Later he was shocked to find out that he had been running on a trail past a visible cairn field two or three times a week for years,
        without ever noticing those nicely shaped structures.

      <p>
        Although Susan Blackstone is not a native Vermonter, she has spent most of her adult life in the far northeast hills of Vermont and
        likes to refer to herself as a transplant.
        She came to Vermont in the 70’s as part of the “Back to the Land Movement”.
        She studied video production, acting, and photography in college and had a professional background in sales and marketing within the publishing industry
        before becoming interested in holistic healing modalities.
        She is a Nationally Certified Reflexologist and Teacher and operates a small holistic center and Airbnb out of her home in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont.
        She is currently the Vermont State Coordinator and an active member of the NEARA Library Committee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Susan was first introduced to the mysterious concept of an Ancient Vermont in the early 80’s when some friends showed her photographs
        of standing stones and stone chambers around central Vermont.
        After visiting a stone chamber known as Calendar Two “It was love at first site” and she was determined to learn more about this fascinating subject.
        While working for the American Society of Dowsers she discovered a copy of the NEARA Transit at their bookstore
        and contacted the then chapter coordinator, Lisa Gannon.
        Lisa was leading some summer field trips at the time and introduced her to an old time NEARA Member Ernie Clifford.
        Susan had the opportunity to visit many lesser known sites around central Vermont with Ernie and Lisa and attended her first
        NEARA Conference in New Hampshire in 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past year, Susan has been working on organizing the NEARA VT files by county and matching up old site reports with new and updated materials.
        She has also been active in working on the library database and familiarizing herself with the NEARA Library’s unusual and unique contents.
        She is an avid travel photographer with a keen interest in Ancient Civilizations.
        She is working on a photo journal of her many trips to the megalithic sites she has visited in Mexico, Aruba, the UK, India, and Egypt.
        Her plans for the NEARA Vermont Chapter are to arrange small field trips this summer and fall to some of the lesser known sites around the state.
        She is also interested in engaging her chapter members by means of online meetings.
        She is honored to serve NEARA as the Vermont Chapter Coordinator and is looking forward to a more socially interactive year ahead.

  <div class="bio">
    <img class="portrait" src="/bios/FRED MARTIN PHOTO.jpg">
    <span class="text">
      <p>
        Frederick W. Martin earned his doctorate in physics at Yale University in 1964.
        After a stint in commercial semiconductor research, he served at universities located in Europe, Kentucky, and Maryland where
        he taught classes and led research into atomic collisions at high velocities funded by the National Science Foundation.
        Subsequently he founded two small research companies using such collisions in microscopy,
        leading to more NSF support, patents, more publications, and a specialized lens sold worldwide before retirement in 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1975 he read the works of the British professor Alexander Thom, especially his book Megalithic Lunar Observatories,
        and began fieldwork in archaeology as an avocation.
        Like Byron Dix, he set out to find stone remains in New England.
        With wife Beppy and young children he made many weekend visits to walking sites with names retaining the Puritan association
        of Native American meeting places with devil worship, or with the name of the Wampanoag tribe leader “King Philip.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This led to much work on King Philip’s Rocks in Sharon MA, including a GPS survey with the town conservation agent,
        an early oral report at the NEARA 2001 Fall Meeting, preservation of 150 acres by town meeting votes,
        two articles in the Bulletin of the Massachusetts Archaeological Society with Ted Ballard and Jim Mavor,
        another oral report on the Archaic date of the site (by Lockyer’s method) at a combined NEARA/MAS meeting,
        and a certificate of appreciation from the Sharon Friends of Conservation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first NEARA report led to published work with Polly Midgley, Beppy Martin, and Walter Wheeler on the possible sightings of the setting sun and
        moon as seen from the semicircular plaza in front of the Kings Chamber in Putnam Valley NY.
        Realization of the opportunity to do OSL dating during repair of the Upton Chamber for public safety reasons led to published work with Cathy Taylor
        which proved for the first time that a chamber was constructed prior to European settlement.
        Much more still unpublished work on sightlines at the Balanced Rock in Canton MA, which face southwards where the moon cannot rise,
        has led to identification of sightlines to the ends of the Milky Way on the horizon, both at Canton and larger sites such as Newark, Ohio,
        Lizard Mounds, Wisconsin, and Chimney Rock, Colorado.

        Martin has provided short summaries of some of his finding at NEARA conferences and made two Zoom presentations
        at the 2021 fall NEARA conference: on using LiDAR to find sites and on two stone chambers.

        Lee W. Shoemaker is a native of Eastern Pennsylvania, growing up in the Lehigh Valley and currently living in Northern Montgomery County.
        He has traveled extensively over the past fifty-five years, visiting all 50 states as well as six of the seven continents.
        Lee taught Industrial Arts and Technology Education for thirty-five years and was instrumental in launching the first STEM program in his school district.
        He has been enjoying retirement for the past eighteen years.

      <p>
        In the early 1970’s, he and his wife Betty purchased 10 acres of wooded land in Northern Montgomery County and began the never-ending task
        of self-construction of their home.
        Over the past half century Lee managed to find moments to walk through the surrounding woodland.
        Like most NEARA members, Lee, on his ramblings began to notice the many stone walls and curious stone features in the surrounding forests. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After reading an intriguing article in a local newspaper featuring Fred Werkheiser’s lithic studies, the search began.
        It did not take long to find NEARA.
        Over the past six years the Shoemakers have attended numerous conferences and have recently become more involved with the Pennsylvania chapter events.

      <p>
        Nancy Berke was introduced to NEARA when attending the annual American Society of Dowsers conferences in Vermont.
        She found that her curiosity about archaeoastronomy, earth mysteries, earth energies, and
        stone circle sites was shared by members of an interesting organization called NEARA.
        Members of ASD and NEARA were similarly intrigued by the compelling research being done at local calendar sites,
        specifically Calendar One, Calendar Two, and America’s Stonehenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having been drawn to the study of megalithic sites in Europe, it was joining NEARA in 2006 that served to expand
        Nancy’s horizons in a number of fascinating areas including:
        ancient civilizations and ancient sea peoples; early trans-oceanic travel and exploration; archaeoacoustics of stone age temples of Malta;
        the theory of diffusionist culture; the Solutrean hypothesis; Viking exploration in North America;
        the mound builders of the mid-west and earthwork remnants that remain such as Cahokia and Serpent Mound; and
        the pervasive rock piles, standing stones, chambers and propped boulders of New England with their similarities to lithic structures throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nancy became a Director-at-Large in 2007 and her primary contributions to NEARA have been as Conference Book Table Coordinator
        and member/Chairperson of the Library and Archives Committee.
        Since 2015, she has been closely involved with the relocation and reorganization of the Library as well as with the creation of
        a new online database for the book collection.
        Nancy is always happy to meet members at the Library in Nashua, NH to help facilitate the borrowing and purchasing of books.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being involved with the Library and the Book Table for 14 years has allowed her to recognize and appreciate the wide-ranging interests of the NEARA membership.
        She values the members’ unique perspectives of focus and study in the realm of antiquity, both historic and Neolithic,
        and enjoys learning from them about the enigmatic stone structures which provide the thread that binds their interests together.

      <p>
        David Brody is the author of 13 novels, most of which focus on sites and artifacts in New England evidencing exploration of America before Columbus.
        He has appeared as a guest expert on documentaries airing on History Channel, Discovery, Travel Channel, PBS, and the Science Channel.
        A graduate of Tufts University and Georgetown Law School, David first served on the NEARA Board in 2007-2010 and has now returned for a second term.
      </p>
      <p>
        A longtime resident of Westford, Massachusetts, David first joined NEARA in 2006 as a result of his interest in the Westford Knight
        and Westford Boat Stone carvings.
        His children call him a “rock nerd” because of the time he spends exploring stone carvings and chambers around New England.
        One of his favorite locations is America’s Stonehenge, where you can often find him on solstice and equinox sunrises and sunsets
        observing the various astronomical alignments.
        You can also be sure to find him at the Newport Tower on the morning of the winter solstice observing the fascinating “keystone orb”
        illumination—he has not missed this event in 13 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        David now resides in Newburyport Massachusetts with his wife, sculptor Kimberly Scott.
        He spends much of his time traveling the country and visiting Europe to view ancient megalithic sites, which he then incorporates into his novels.
        These novels tend to focus on one key question: Did ancient peoples visit America before Columbus?
        It is a question that keeps David—and many other NEARA members—up at night.

      <p>
        Dave Gutkowski is a successful storage business owner, licensed private pilot, licensed massage therapist,
        accomplished Reiki master, and amateur astronomer from Ashley, PA.
        He attended Bishop Hoban High School and Penn State University where he studied Mechanical Engineering.
        Upon graduation Dave took a job with the US Postal Service, and during his 30-year career worked every job available in order to continue learning.
        Dave officially retired from the USPS in 2009 as postmaster of Shawanese, PA where he met his partner Carla.  
      </p>
      <p>
        After discovering a curiously arranged collection of large boulders on a mountaintop meadow in 2004 Dave’s interest in stone landscapes was born.
        He felt drawn to the boulders he called ‘Council Rocks’ and joined NEARA in 2007.
        That year, and with the help of veteran member Fred Martin, he found the uniquely shaped boulders to be perfectly aligned with both solstice and equinox events.
        Using his astronomy background, he successfully researched, documented and established the site as a potential late-archaic
        archaeoastronomy site with the PA Historic Preservation Office.
        He was awarded an official site designation from the SHPO in 2011 and presented his findings on Council Rocks at a NEARA conference in 2012.
        He continues his research at the Council Rocks site and nearby Alpenglow Rockshelter for which he also received a site designation from the SHPO in 2019.
        Dave was invited to serve on the NEARA board and as PA Coordinator in 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dave and Carla currently reside in Bear Creek, PA surrounded by pets and wildlife and have been known to hand-feed visiting raccoons and white-tailed deer.
        They love hiking and nature photography.
        His work over the past decade has led to giving presentations on both sites at numerous archaeology conferences in PA, NY, and VA,
        as well as meetings for avocational groups within the region and at the AAPS annual meetings in Michigan.
        Recent work on the mountain includes large area LiDAR scans and ground-penetrating radar scans at the rockshelter.
        Both have produced even more sites and findings of interest.
        He hopes to bring his decades of learning and astronomy skills to help research and further document alignments for many long-standing NEARA projects.

        Jim Haskin’s first role in the U.S. army, as Assistant Section Chief, was to maintain radar equipment and fire control computer systems.
        Within 24 months Jim, now Sargent Haskins, entered a different field - servicing digital communication equipment.
        Eventually Jim became part of a team of specialists who traveled internationally to install communication equipment.
        In civilian clothes Jim worked for several high-tech companies until he was accepted by the University of R.I. to pursue a degree in Industrial Engineering.
        Jim has been a member of NEARA since 2015.
        He lived in many states across America and has always been interested in hiking and exploring the natural world for as long as he can remember.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past ten years Jim’s interest in indigenous lithic creations became a passion.
        Dr. Curtis Hoffman’s research project of indigenous lithic stone sites along the eastern seaboard propelled Jim to search for and record the same
        in his hometown of Hopkinton, MA and his family home in Denning, NY.
        Jim’s efforts to protect indigenous lithic sites forged collaborations with Doug Harris the recently retired Deputy Tribal Historic Preservation Officer,
        Cathy Taylor the Steward of Upton, MA Chamber & Narragansett Indian Tribal Historic Preservation Trust, and Eva Gibavic of Ceremonial Landscapes Research LLC.
        Jim co-hosted two Ceremonial Stone Landscape presentations for the Hopkinton Public Library and the Hopkinton Historical Society with Doug Harris.
        Jim and Doug Harris worked with the Hopkinton Planning Board to ensure that a solar company protected Ceremonial Stone features,
        which Jim discovered and recorded, on land they leased in Hopkinton.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jim serves on the Board of Directors of the Hopkinton Historical Society and is an alternate Board Member for the Hopkinton Historical Commission.
        Jim looks forward to continuing his mission of preserving lithic sites through encouraging informed decision making and communication
        between local governments, tribal officials, and potential Developers.

        The majority of his professional career has been in research & development and he developed new products while working for the Merch Millipore and 3M Corporations.
        As an avid history buff Tom joined the Westford Knight Committee in the 1980’s.
        He was on the Westford Planning Board, the Conservation Commission, and he helped start and run the local Land Trust.
        His work eventually brought him to Madison CT in 1995.
      </p>
      <p>
        After discussing the interesting stonework around his new home in Madison CT, Tom’s friend Norman Biggart told him about NEARA and their interest in lithic sites.
        He joined NEARA in 1997 and started to research the many stone piles in the open space nearby his home and on his property.
        He became the NEARA Treasurer in 1998 and held that position for 22 years.
        Being on the Madison Wetland Board and the Land Trust Board he walked much of the open space in his town.
        After being on a NEARA Conference Field Trip Tom started to look for stone structure alignments on his hikes through the woods and
        soon discovered a summer solstice alignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tom has been studying this alignment for more than 23 years and named it The Hammonasset Line after the Native American Tribe who lived in the area in the 1700’s.
        The line consists of one stone complex after another starting at a huge quartzite boulder at Fort Hill Cemetery in Montauk NY and
        extends through the Catskill Mountains to Devil’s Tombstone in Hunter NY.
        If you extend the line further, it goes to an area in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula know for its ancient copper mines.
        Tom is long retired and is still hard at work researching his intriguing discovery.
