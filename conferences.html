  <h2 id="Conferences">Conferences</h2>
  <p>
    NEARA meets twice annually, in the Spring and Fall, at various locations around New England and eastern New York.
    Field trips normally take place on Friday afternoon and Sunday morning.
    We hold program sessions Friday evening and all day Saturday into the evening, with a longer keynote presentation after dinner.
  </p>
  <p>
    We explore a broad range of topics at our conferences.
    The peopling of the Americas, pre-Columbian voyages, new technologies that help examine our world, and
    especially northeastern indigenous stonework have all been grist for our mill.
    Representative recent programs are linked below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conferences provide opportunities to network, purchase books, and participate in field trips to
    see examples of regional indigenous stonework and other structures.
  </p>

  <h3>2019 Fall Conference</h3>
  <strong>Indigenous American Civilizations</strong>
  <p>
    This conference will feature a focus on the overall subject of 
    civilizations, including how they are defined and the indicia of their 
    presence. Several perspectives will be offered on this 
    important and complex subject, including how this subject pertains to 
    the Northeast.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the Spanish began to enter southeastern North America in the early 
    16<sup>th</sup> Century, they reported still active vestiges of the great mound 
    building tradition of the Mississippian civilization. In the 18<sup>th</sup> 
    Century, with the westward expansion into the Ohio Valley, early 
    explorers and settlers encountered complex and massive geometric 
    earthworks that were intuitively perceived to be remnants of a vanished 
    civilization. Most of these monumental constructions were of earth, but 
    some were stone. Scholars back East were intrigued by this subject. 
    This 1786 Ohio earthworks survey survives among the correspondence of 
    Thomas Jefferson, sent to him by Yale president Ezra Stiles.

  <i>Library of Congress</i>
  <p>
    By 1848, when the Smithsonian published its first work, <em>
    <a href="https://www.wdl.org/en/item/4301/view/1/11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ancient 
    Monuments of the Mississippi Valley</a></em> by Squier and Davis, the publication 
    contained numerous surveys acquired over decades of work. It remains the 
    most significant work the Smithsonian has produced. 30 years ago, when 
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Manitou-Sacred-Landscape-Englands-Civilization/dp/0892810785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mavor and Dix</a>
    replicated for the Northeast what Squire and Davis had 
    done further west 141 years earlier, the subtitle of their book was <em>The 
    Sacred Landscape of New Englandâ€™s Native Civilization</em>. A similar history 
    of the modern recognition of the ancient ceremonial architecture of the Anasazi civilization of 
    the Southwest could be related. It has long been 
    evident the Americas contain a complex history of advanced societies, 
    far more detailed than the simplistic Maya, Aztec and Inca sequence of popular 
    conception.
